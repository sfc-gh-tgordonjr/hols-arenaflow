# ArenaFlow Intelligence Hub: Hands-On Lab

Welcome to the ArenaFlow Intelligence Hub hands-on lab! This interactive experience is designed to give you and your team a deep dive into utilizing Cortex Functions within Snowflake to process and analyze unstructured data efficiently. 

## Overview

In the fast-paced environment of a stadium filled with buzzing fans, tweets are constantly being generated about the game, the food, and the overall atmosphere. Our ArenaFlow Intelligence Hub turns this rock concert-like chaos into actionable insights, providing you with real-time analytics on fan sentiment, trends, and operational highlights.

### Key Features

Throughout this lab, we'll leverage the following Snowflake and Cortex AI features:

- **[Snowflake Cortex](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions)**: This module covers task-specific functions to analyze sentiment and summarization. You'll learn to create a prompt and response with Cortex Complete.

- **[Snowflake Notebooks on Container Runtime](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/notebooks-on-spcs)**: Get hands-on experience with executing notebooks on a GPU-powered compute pool, leveraging pre-built images with Python packages, and creating external access integrations for additional packages.

- **[Triggered Tasks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro#triggered-tasks)**: Automate data processing with task execution triggered by specific data changes.

- **[Dynamic Tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-intro)**: Learn to incrementally process changed data, transforming it into meaningful insights.

- **[Cortex Analyst](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst)**: Create chat applications for an interactive "talk to your data" experience.

- **[Streamlit in Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit)**: Host your applications directly within Snowsight for seamless integration.
